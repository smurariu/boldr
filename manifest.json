  "description": "This is an extension that helps with speed reading. It works by making every fifth word in a sentence bold. When reading only the words in bold, your perihperal vision will be able to pick up the surrounding words thus enabling you to read faster. It takes a little getting used to but once you learn it your reading speed will be up 30 to 40 percent.",
